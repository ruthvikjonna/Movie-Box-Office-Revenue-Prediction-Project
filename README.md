# Movie Box Office Revenue Prediction Project

### Description
Welcome to my Movie Box Office Revenue Prediction Project! In this project, I analyzed the movies_metadata.csv file, which is a dataset that contains information on over 45,000 
movies, including 26 million ratings from over 270,000 users. This project consists of two components: regression and classification. To start, I utilized machine learning 
regression techniques to predict the box office revenue for a newly released movie. Afterward, I utilized machine learning classification techniques to predict whether newly 
released movies would fall into three separate classifications of success: high success, medium success, or low success.

### ML Regression Techniques Used
- Simple Linear Regression
- Simple Linear Regression (10 Fold Cross-Validation)
- Forward Stepwise Selection
- Backward Stepwise Selection
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Regression Tree

### ML Classification Techniques Used
- Classification (Decision) Tree
- Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging)
- Random Forest
- Boosting

### Conclusion
From conducting these various regression methods on our data, it can be seen that the simple linear regression with a 10 fold cross validation proves to be the most accurate model when predicting a movie's box office revenue (considering these specific factors). From conducting these various classification methods on our data, it can be seen that the bootstrap aggregating (bagging) method proves to be the most accurate model (97.4% accuracy) when classifying movies into having high success, medium success, or low success.
