# Movie Box Office Revenue Prediction Project

### Description
Welcome to my Movie Box Office Revenue Prediction Project! In this project, I analyzed the movies_metadata.csv file, which is a dataset that contains information on over 45,000 
movies, including 26 million ratings from over 270,000 users. This project consists of two components: regression and classification. To start, I utilized machine learning 
regression techniques to predict the box office revenue for a newly released movie. Afterward, I utilized machine learning classification techniques to predict whether newly 
released movies would fall into three separate classifications of success: high success, medium success, or low success.
